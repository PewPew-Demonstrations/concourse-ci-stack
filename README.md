- A VPC with appropriate subnets, NAT gateways and security groups.
- Two ECS clusters with EC2 instances in auto-scaling groups
    - An admin cluster that runs ConcourseCI's web service
    - A worker cluster that runs ConcourseCI workers
    - Task definitions and services are setup
- CloudWatch log groups are setup to capture logs from ECS tasks
- An RDS instance that is used by ConcourseCI
    - It is bootstrapped as part of the admin task definition
- ELBs integrated with ECS admin service
- A subdomain added under `.demo.ardel.io` with SSL (on the ELB)
- All resources are tagged with project name, type (CD) and team.
